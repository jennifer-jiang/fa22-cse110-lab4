4. The code returns an error "ReferenceError: result is not defined" because "result" was only defined in the scope of the if statement.
5. The code returns an error "TypeError: Assignment to constant variable." because declaring a variable with the const keyword means the variable value cannot be reassigned after declaration.
6. Nothing is printed due to the error explained in answer 5. Additionally, the const keyword has the same scope as the let keyword, meaning the variable "result" is only defined in the scope of the if statement and is not accessible outside the if statement.
